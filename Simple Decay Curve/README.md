# Radioactive Decay Simulation

## Description
This Python program simulates the radioactive decay of a given number of atoms over time using a simple exponential decay model. The program plots the number of remaining atoms as a function of time.

## Features
- Simulates decay of `N0` atoms with a given decay constant.
- Plots the number of atoms vs. time.
- Easy to modify parameters such as initial atoms, decay constant, and simulation time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Parameters

N0 : Initial number of atoms 

decay_constant : Decay constant Î»

time_steps : Number of simulation steps 
dt : Size of each time step 

You can modify these parameters in the script to simulate different scenarios.
